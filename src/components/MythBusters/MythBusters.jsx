              Viruses cannot travel on radio waves/mobile networks. COVID-19 is
              spreading in many countries that do not have 5G mobile networks.
              COVID-19 is spread through respiratory droplets when an infected
              person coughs, sneezes or speaks. People can also be infected by
              touching a contaminated surface and then their eyes, mouth or
              nose.

              You can catch COVID-19, no matter how sunny or hot the weather is.
              Countries with hot weather have reported cases of COVID-19. To
              protect yourself, make sure you clean your hands frequently and
              thoroughly and avoid touching your eyes, mouth, and nose.

              The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are dry cough, tiredness and
              fever. Some people may develop more severe forms of the disease,
              such as pneumonia. The best way to confirm if you have the virus
              producing COVID-19 disease is with a laboratory test. You cannot
              confirm it with this breathing exercise, which can even be
              dangerous.

            <p>
              To date there has been no information nor evidence to suggest that
              the new coronavirus could be transmitted by mosquitoes. The new
              coronavirus is a respiratory virus which spreads primarily through
              droplets generated when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or
              through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose. To protect
              yourself, clean your hands frequently with an alcohol-based hand
              rub or wash them with soap and water. Also, avoid close contact
              with anyone who is coughing and sneezing.

              frequently clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash
              them with soap and water. Once your hands are cleaned, you should

              Thermal scanners are effective in detecting people who have
              developed a fever (i.e. have a higher than normal body
              temperature) because of infection with the new coronavirus.
              However, they cannot detect people who are infected but are not
              yet sick with fever. This is because it takes between 2 and 10
              days before people who are infected become sick and develop a
              fever.

            <p>
              No. Spraying alcohol or chlorine all over your body will not kill
              viruses that have already entered your body. Spraying such
              substances can be harmful to clothes or mucous membranes (i.e.
              eyes, mouth). Be aware that both alcohol and chlorine can be
              useful to disinfect surfaces, but they need to be used under
              appropriate recommendations.

              No. Vaccines against pneumonia, such as pneumococcal vaccine and
              Haemophilus influenza type B (Hib) vaccine, do not provide
              protection against the new coronavirus. The virus is so new and
              different that it needs its own vaccine. Researchers are trying to
              develop a vaccine against 2019-nCoV, and WHO is supporting their
              efforts. Although these vaccines are not effective against
              2019-nCoV, vaccination against respiratory illnesses is highly
              recommended to protect your health.

              No. There is no evidence that regularly rinsing the nose with

              Garlic is a healthy food that may have some antimicrobial

              People of all ages can be infected by the new coronavirus

              from the virus, for example by following good hand hygiene and
              good respiratory hygiene.

              No, antibiotics do not work against viruses, only bacteria. The

              should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment. However,
              if you are hospitalized for the 2019-nCoV, you may receive
              antibiotics because bacterial co-infection is possible.

              with the virus should receive appropriate care to relieve and

              optimized supportive care. Some specific treatments are under
